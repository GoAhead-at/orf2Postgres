# Proposed Update for History File Rule

## Current Rule
The current rule in the .NET Cursor Rules states:

```
## History
- keep a history file ./DOCS/history.md with all steps already adressed in an AI promt format after each step you made for easy context recovery
```

## Proposed Updated Rule

```
## History File Maintenance
- Maintain a structured history file at './DOCS/history.md'
- This file should:
  - Follow AI prompt format for easy context recovery between sessions
  - Include essential project details (specifications, architecture, database schema)
  - Be updated after each significant development step or milestone
  - Track the chronological progression of development tasks
  - List current project status and next planned steps
  - Provide enough context that a new AI session could immediately understand the project state
  - Serve as a single source of truth for project progress history
```

## Purpose
This history file acts as a persistent memory between chat sessions. When the conversation context is lost or a new chat session is started, providing this file allows quick recovery of all important context and prevents redundant questions or work.

## Implementation Notes
- The AI assistant should update this file after each significant development step
- The history should be structured with clear headings and sections
- The file should remain concise yet comprehensive
- Updates should focus on significant milestones rather than minor changes
