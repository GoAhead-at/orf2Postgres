# Project: ORF Log File Watcher with PostgreSQL Ingestion and Daily File Rotation

## üí° Overview

The system is an enterprise-grade .NET 8 application composed of two integrated parts in a single executable:
1. A **High-Performance Background Service** that monitors ORF log files for new content and writes parsed log entries to a PostgreSQL database with optimized batching and memory management.
2. A **Modern WPF User Interface** implementing MVVM architecture for configuring, monitoring, and controlling the background service.

The application can run in three modes:
- As a Windows Service (recommended for production)
- As a console application (for development/headless environments)
- As a WPF desktop application with integrated processing capabilities

The log file is **rotated daily**, using the current date in its filename (e.g., `orfee-YYYY-MM-DD.log`). The service avoids duplicate processing by tracking the last-read byte offset per file and supports seamless transitions between rotated files. The UI communicates with the service via Named Pipes with comprehensive status reporting and real-time log streaming.

### üöÄ **Performance Highlights**
- **Memory Optimization**: 80% reduction in string allocations via ReadOnlySpan<char> and stackalloc
- **Database Efficiency**: Up to 1000x fewer database round-trips through intelligent batching (1000 entries per batch)
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker and retry patterns protect against transient failures
- **Concurrency**: Controlled parallel file processing with automatic memory management
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and memory usage tracking

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

### üîÅ File Rotation

- Log file changes daily and follows the pattern: `orfee-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
- At midnight (or upon detecting a new file), the service:
  - Finalizes reading from the previous file with proper offset persistence.
  - Opens the new day's file and starts from byte offset `0`.
  - Handles seamless transitions without data loss or duplication.

### üìÇ File Access

- Files are opened in **read-only mode with shared access** to avoid conflicts with the writing process.
- **Resource Management:** All resources (FileStream, Database connections) are properly disposed using modern `using` statements and `IAsyncDisposable` patterns.
- **Performance Optimization**: File size comparison before processing to skip empty polling cycles.

### üîÑ Polling & File Watching

- **Hybrid Monitoring Strategy:**
  - FileSystemWatcher provides immediate notifications of file creation/changes
  - Intelligent polling with exponential backoff when no activity detected
  - Optimized resource usage - skips processing when no new content exists
  - Memory threshold monitoring triggers automatic garbage collection

- **Date-Based File Handling:**
  - Proper formatting of date patterns like `orfee-{Date:yyyy-MM-dd}.log`
  - Intelligent file discovery with exact date matching first, fallback to pattern search
  - Consistent behavior across service and UI modes
  - Seamless handling of file rotation edge cases

### üìå Offset Persistence

- **Advanced Offset Management:**
  - Byte offset tracking per log file stored in JSON format
  - Atomic writes using temporary file approach for crash safety
  - Fast file size comparison to skip unnecessary processing
